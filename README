ouexam v2.0

ouexam document class v2.0, 30 January 2002

Copyright 1999--2002 Nigel Stanger and University of Otago

This LaTeX2e document class enables the production of University of Otago
formatted examination papers. It handles all the fiddly layout requirements
(such as printing `TURN OVER' at the bottom of every page except the last),
and also ensures that the actual number of marks for questions in the
examination add up to the expected number of marks.


REQUIREMENTS

ouexam requires the verbatim class, which should be standard on most LaTeX
installations. The class documentation uses the graphicx and hyperref
packages, so you will have to install these first if you don't have them
already.


INSTALLING (UNIX OR SIMILAR)

A makefile is provided:

	* `make' will produce both ouexam.cls and ouexam.dvi (see below).

	* `make class' will produce ouexam.cls. Place this file in a directory
	  somewhere in your TeX search path (e.g., if you use teTeX, put it in
	  texmf/tex/latex/ouexam or somewhere similar).

	* `make doc' will produce ouexam.dvi.
	
	* If you have GhostScript and the dvipdf command, `make pdfdoc' will
	  produce PDF documentation.


INSTALLING (EVERYTHING ELSE)

Run ouexam.ins through LaTeX to produce ouexam.cls. Place this file in a
directory somewhere in your LaTeX search path. Then run ouexam.dtx through
LaTeX _three_ (yes, three) times to produce the documentation (ouexam.dvi).
PDF documentation can be produced from the DVI by whatever means you
normally use to do so.
