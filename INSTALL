ouexam 2.1 Requirements and Installation
========================================

You will need Rainer Schopf's verbatim package in order to use ouexam.
This should come standard with most TeX installations. To build the
documentation and example files, you will need at least version 1.1 of
the listings package, and GhostScript.

To install:

	1 Unpack the distribution archive and cd to the distribution
	  directory.

	2 make
	
	3 make install TEXMF_INSTALL=/path/to/texmf.
	  /path/to/texmf should be the root of your preferred texmf tree
	  (e.g., /usr/share/texmf). You may need to do this as root
	  depending on which texmf tree you are installing into. You can
	  also define TEXMF_INSTALL as an environment variable then simply
	  type make install.

Of course, you may always install manually if you wish.
